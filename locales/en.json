  "about.me": "My name is Patrycja. I have been teaching Polish as a foreign language for 8 years and hold a PhD in the humanities (linguistics). I teach through play, using active methods and gamification. I cooperate with the School of Polish Language and Culture “Pollando” at the University of Białystok, Belsat TV, and local NGOs. I’m also an examiner for certification exams in Polish as a foreign language at the Białystok University of Technology. With the Podlasie Library in Białystok, I co-organize discussion meetings for foreigners and Poles — “Polish-Polish Conversations”, and with the “Window to the East” Foundation and the “Women’s Club” — a “Language Café” for women learning Polish.",

  "brand.paragraph": "The name \"Śledź polski\" is a specific play on words. On the one hand, śledź is the Polish word for \"herring\"—a fish that serves as a symbol of the specific borderland pronunciation characteristic of some residents of Podlasie. This part of my company’s name indicates that the local culture of Podlasie plays a major role in my teaching activities. In my lessons, I strive to introduce local elements, particularly for those students living within the Podlaskie Voivodeship. This stems from my conviction that familiarity with local realities serves as a gateway to integrating with the local community.\n\nOn the other hand, śledź is the imperative form of the verb śledzić, meaning to track, follow, or closely observe something or someone. My classes serve to regularly examine the Polish language along with its nuances. This aspect of my work is also tied to my Instagram account, which aims to popularize knowledge of Polish as a foreign language. Additionally, I lead various meetings and initiatives regarding the Polish language and the Podlasie region, such as \"Rozmówki polsko-polskie\" (Polish-Polish Conversations—a language café for Poles and foreigners) and \"Alfabet podlaski\" (The Podlasie Alphabet—a lecture on local vocabulary).",
